# BT Developer Notes
This is my collection of random notes for use when modding the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) game. I doubt anybody else would find them interesting.

## dotTrace 

To run dotTrace's Unity profiling automatically, place a file called `steam_appid.txt` at `/Battletech/`. It's contents should be just 637090, the steam id for the game. This prevents the hang on start.
