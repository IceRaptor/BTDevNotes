# Concepts to Develop

Random collection of thoughts on things that could be developed

### Hostile Negotiations 

Allow the AI to determine it's completely outmatched and offer to surrender. Based upon faction and type. They will require you to let them keep their mechs, and may have other consequences?

### Tactical Flexibility

Allow use of airstrikes, artillery, etc from a command bar

### Tutorializer

Allow injection of tutorial content like in the EW gear
