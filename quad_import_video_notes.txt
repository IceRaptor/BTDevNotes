- Scene shown has wepaon prefabs as 'quad_LOC_turret_wep_idx'
- structure appears to be:
  - bargest_turret/base/rotate
  - bargbody/rotate/CT_LT_RT_plus_damage_models/
- He adds cylinders bargbody/rotate/cylinder and makes sure the model can rotate around them
  - this one is set fo rthe rear legs?
- he does the same for the front_legs_attach
- texture is named <model>body (jgoliathbody)
- uses centre_torso and centre_torso_damaged as names
-  damaged texture is <model>body_damaged
- positions the _vfx_transform objects appropriately
- positions jumpjet points
- positions turret model under attach point, sizes the turret_attach_hardpoint
  - names it <model>_turret
- Places turret model under jgoliathbody/rotate/turret_attach/jgoliath_turret/base/rotate/turret/jvboliath_turret_no_barrer
- Creates a cylinder to align the turr et aix, under jgoliah_turret/base/rotate/cylinder
- turret gets body texture
- creates animator at CT_LT_RT_plus_damage_models/
  - supports damage_idle, damage_lt, damage_rt - shows the _damaged GO, hides the regular
  - turret_left_idle, turret_right_idle - needs to support to_fire_normal, recoil, indirect params
- exports to prefabs for jgoliath_turret, jgoliathbody
- legs ataches are defined in the chassisdef under CustomParts
  - quadVisualInfo: FLegsPrefab / FLegsPrefabBase / RLegsPrefabBase
  - CustomParts: distance length is the delta of front_legs_attach from rear_legs_attach
  - prefab: is the name of the prefab from Unity (jgoliathbody)
  - materialInfo: should have all mats used in the parts
  - AnimationData: DamageAnimator links to the GO in unity where the animations are linked
  - have one section for prefab: jgolith and a second for prefab: jgoliath_turret
  - interestingly here; can use multiple mats (as before)
- chassisdef uses prefabIdentifier of chrprfmech_atlasbase-001 
- hardpoint
  - looks identical to regular import process
- mod.json
  - imports jgoliath_parts for jgoliath_turret, jgoliathbody prefabs
  - imports weapon prefsba from jgolaith_parts 
- edits chassisdef, sets AnimationData:AttachPoints to have CenterTorso location under turret definition
- in model name will be prefab (atlas as above), can search by body elements though


NOTES

- legs prefab looks like it must be based off same parent maybe? 
- not sure what suppressAllMeshes does
- all skinnedMeshRenderers need to be under meshes, linked to an arbitrary bone under j_bone
- note; you'll only have chrprfmech, body and weapon prefabs; turret is under body prefab
- unity editor will only apply paint to single mat at a time; if a mesh has 2+ mats only the first is 'painted'
  - this can appear as though parts 'vanish' when SkinnedMeshRenderer is applied
